Use latex whenever you have to. For figures either use `<img>` tags or provide the code-snippet that will generate the figures in place. You will turn in both the `.pdf` and `.ipynb` versions of this notebook as your project report, and your checkoff for this lab will count as your \"Final Demo\". If the packages are not successfully installed using this notebook consider installing with command line using `pip` or `conda`.\n",

    "The DC motor is one of the most common actuators in control systems. It converts the electrical energy to rotational motion. The electrical equivalent circuit of the armatrure and the diagram of the rotor are shown below:\n",

    "The input to the system is the voltage applied to the motor's armature, and the output is the rotational velocity $\\omega_r = \\dot{\\theta}$. The rotor and shaft are assumed to be rigid and we will assume the viscous friction model is appropriate, meaning that the friction torque will be proportional to angular velocity. Thusly, friction can be modeled by a viscous damper, shown in the table below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Moreover, as the motor rotates a voltage will be induced which opposes the input voltage source. It is generated by the rotation of the electrical coil through the flux lines of the permanent magnets (i.e., the magnetic field). This voltage is often referred to as the back EMF (Electromotive Force), and its value is proportional to the angular velocity:\n",

    "In this section we will create an LQR (linear quadratic regulator) controller for our system. Let's do a quick high-level overview of the LQR controller. What we did before in the SIXT33N control lab was pole-placement control. Basically, we were trying the find the feedback factor ($K_{fb}$) that directly moved the poles of the closed-loop system to our desired stable locations (If you don't exactly know what poles are, just think of them as abstracted notions that control the dynamics of your control system, represented by the system's eigenvalues). The figure below shows how the closed-loop system was created. We took our state variable (i.e. $\\delta[k]$) and mulitplied it by feedback gain (i.e. $K_L+K_R$), and subtracted it from a reference (i.e. v*), and then fed it back in to the system to produce the output (i.e. $v[k]$). \n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out it is difficult to have an intuition about where to place the poles if you have a system with more than two state variables. However, it is easier and more intuitive to think about how you want your system to behave in terms of its performance and cost. LQR is a different view that takes into account the objective of the control system in the time-domain by explicitly minimizing a quadratic cost function in terms of state and input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the infinite-horizon, continuous-time formulation of the LQR. The name LQR comes from the following facts:  we are controlling a *linear* system, we use a cost function which is *quadratic* in control and error, and the *regulator* problem is concerned with sending $x(t)\\rightarrow 0$. \"Infinite-horizon\" means we are considering the total cost as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost $\\widehat{J}$ is often defined as a sum of the deviations of key measurements (e.g. input voltage, $\\delta[k]$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{J} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} {(x^TQx + u^TRu)dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We define $x^TQx$ to be the instantaneous cost of error and $u^TRu$ to be the instantaneous cost of control. $Q$ and $R$ are weighting factors that incorporate our preference in terms of performance ($x$) and cost ($u$). Because $x$ and $u$ are normally vectors, $Q$ and $R$ are *positive-definite* matrices that create a quadratic/convex cost function to optimize on. The integral is just summing the cost over all time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LQR algorithm reduces the amount of work done by the control systems engineer to optimize the controller. However, the engineer still needs to specify the cost function parameters, and compare the results with the specified design goals. Often this means that controller construction will be an iterative process in which the engineer judges the \"optimal\" controllers produced through simulation and then adjusts the parameters to produce a controller more consistent with design goals, which is what you will do in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of LQR is to find a feedback matrix $K$ such that $u=-Kx$ minimizes the cost function. You do not have to do the math yourself as there are python packages that will do this for you. You can call something like `control.lqr(A, B, Q, R)` and it will return the optimal K that you can use to build your controller."
